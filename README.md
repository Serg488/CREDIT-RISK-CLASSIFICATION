# CREDIT-RISK-CLASSIFICATION
Presumably, the reason we're developing this algorithimic solution, is because we want an easy way to approve or deny loans. Unforuntately since the precision of the model in identifying high-risk accounts is ONLY 84%... this means, of all the people that we deny for loans, 16% of them are actually totally healthy. In other words, we'd be sending a very confusing and unsatisfying message to a fairly high proportion of our user-base which will not be good for the company's reputation.
